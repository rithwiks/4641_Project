## Topic

## Introduction/Background

## Problem Definition

## Methods

## Potential Results and Discussion
We have two potential metrics we could predict given a movie's information: ratings or box office performance. These would both be quantitative measurements that could help producers determine if a movie would be successful or help movie-goers determine if a movie is worth watching. Since both of these values are numeric, we could utilize a loss metric like MSE to validate our results and help train our model. Our goal would be to be able to predict these values accurately given the title, genre, runtime, actors, directors, etc.
