## Topic

## Introduction/Background

## Problem Definition

## Methods

## Potential Results and Discussion
We have two potential metrics we could predict given a movie's information: ratings or box office performance. These would both be quantitative measurements that could help producers determine if a movie would be successful or help movie-goers determine if a movie is worth watching. Since both of these values are numeric, we could utilize a loss metric like MSE to validate our results and help train our model. Our goal would be to be able to predict these values accurately given the title, genre, runtime, actors, directors, etc.

- This research paper focuses on movie preference anaysis based on of digital content on the internet like forums, review sites, blogs, and news outlets, which contains a lot of opinionated data. This research paper employees these resources to predict online user preferences by identifying and categorizing opinions that are available on internet. Specifically, the study focuses on sentiment analysis using online movie reviews for classification, which is closely related to our project. Investigation using three supervised machine learning algorithms - Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) - this study have shown that that the SVM technique was superior, achieving accuracy rates of at least 80% when it is  trained on an massive dataset.
